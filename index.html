				<h2>Introduction to Self-Care</h2>
				<p class="intro">Self-care is a term used by <a href="htdocs/glossary.html#mental health">mental health</a> experts to define the activities we perform to 
				keep our mental, physical, and emotional strength in good condition. Although it is a simple 
				concept to understand, we often overlook its importance to our wellness in the long run. It

				<h2>Self-Care during Quarantine</h2>
				<p class="qtine">In the ongoing <a href="htdocs/glossary.html#pandmemic">pandemic</a>, we are all locked up in our homes for most of the time to avoid 
				contact with other human beings. Staying home for a long time can be stressful since we are limited 
				to the resources we have at home, and we can't go out to de-stress or see our friends and relatives. 
				Now is the ideal time to focus on our health and make time to build a self-care routine that will 
				help us cope with the current happenings.</p><br><br><br>
